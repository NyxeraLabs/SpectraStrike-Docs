# E2E Execution Audit Report

## Scope

Asymmetric federation hardening verification for SpectraStrike <-> VectorVue with local persistent federation config.

## Commands Used

```bash
cd SpectraStrike
make local-federation-up
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pkg.integration.host_integration_smoke --tenant-id 10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 --check-vectorvue
sliver-client version
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_firecracker_microvm_runner.py
```

Signed cognitive verification command path:

- Sent signed execution graph metadata to `/internal/v1/cognitive/execution-graph`
- Queried `/internal/v1/cognitive/feedback/adjustments/query`
- Verified response signature and attestation hash binding in SpectraStrike client

## Runtime Evidence

Primary host smoke output:

- `vectorvue_event_status=accepted`
- `vectorvue_finding_status=accepted`
- `vectorvue_status_poll_status=accepted`
- `nmap_binary_ok=True`
- `metasploit_binary_ok=True`

Cognitive verification output:

- `graph_status=accepted`
- `feedback_status=accepted`
- `feedback_signature_verified=True`
- `attestation_hash_verified=True`

Firecracker runtime evidence:

- `tests/unit/test_firecracker_microvm_runner.py` -> `4 passed`

Audit log artifact:

- `local_docs/audit/final-e2e-asymmetric-20260227-134036.log`

## Signature Verification Proof

- Telemetry ingress accepted only when Ed25519 signature validated at gateway.
- Feedback response included `kid`, `signature_algorithm=Ed25519`, `signed_at`, `nonce`.
- SpectraStrike verifier marked feedback envelope as `verified=True`.

## Attestation Proof

- `attestation_measurement_hash` present in signed cognitive graph payload.
- Returned feedback adjustments preserved attestation hash.
- SpectraStrike attestation match check returned `attestation_hash_verified=True`.

## Failure Cases Tested

- Sliver wrapper dry-run failed with CLI flag mismatch (`--target`) and was rejected as execution path failure.
- Replay/signed-response rejection, forged signature rejection, and schema mismatch paths are covered by updated federation unit tests.

## Final Conclusion

Federation path is operating under asymmetric cryptographic controls with hard-fail verification, attestation propagation, and accepted end-to-end telemetry/finding flow. Remaining operational gap is Sliver wrapper CLI compatibility, which is isolated from the federation trust controls.
