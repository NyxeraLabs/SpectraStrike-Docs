## Standard Procedure (Future Tasks)

For every remaining wrapper, apply this exact sequence:
1. Implement wrapper with standardized SDK contract.
2. Run real E2E test (no dry-run) with controlled target.
3. Add/validate unit tests.
4. Add/validate smoke test.
5. Validate telemetry schema.
6. Create/refresh full docs set under `docs/wrappers/<wrapper>/`.
7. Update this matrix checkboxes and category percentages.
