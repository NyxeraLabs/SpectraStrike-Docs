# SpectraStrike Roadmap – Phases, Sprints, and Commits

![SpectraStrike Logo](../ui/web/assets/images/SprectraStrike_Logo.png)

> **ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT NOTICE (v2.0):** 
> As of Phase 4, SpectraStrike transitions from a legacy "wrapper-based" orchestration tool into a **Policy-Driven, Cryptographically Verifiable Universal Execution Fabric**. Future phases prioritize BYOT (Bring Your Own Tool), ephemeral hardware isolation, cryptographic non-repudiation (JWS/Merkle Trees), and Zero-Trust authorization via OPA. This architecture is designed to seamlessly feed structured, verifiable telemetry to **VectorVue** via our messaging backbone (RabbitMQ/Kafka) to empower its ML/Cognition and Compliance engines.
