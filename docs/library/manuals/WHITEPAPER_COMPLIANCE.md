# Whitepaper Compliance Check (Sprint 16.8)

Scope:
- Compared implementation against `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`.
- Focused on architecture claims relevant to current delivered phases.

## Compliance Summary

- `PARTIAL`: Core RabbitMQ backbone and VectorVue broker-bridge flow are implemented.
- `PARTIAL`: Zero-Trust controls exist (AAA/OPA hooks, TLS/mTLS options), but not all whitepaper controls are fully enforced end-to-end.
- `NOT YET`: Non-repudiation Merkle ledger and Firecracker runtime are roadmap-future and not complete.

## Requirement Matrix

1. Cryptographic execution only (JWS signed manifests, anti-replay at runner): `PARTIAL`
2. Decoupled authorization via OPA for execution decisions: `PARTIAL`
3. Broker dispatch over mTLS, tenant routing controls: `PARTIAL`
4. BYOT CloudEvents output contract: `PARTIAL`
5. C2 gateway adapter model (Sliver/Mythic): `NOT YET`
6. Formal non-repudiation Merkle tree + inclusion proofs: `NOT YET`
7. SPIFFE/SPIRE workload identity rotation: `NOT YET`
8. Firecracker ephemeral microVM boundary: `NOT YET`
9. VectorVue delivery via messaging backbone: `IMPLEMENTED in Sprint 16.8`

## Sprint 16.8 Delta

- Added RabbitMQ-to-VectorVue bridge (`src/pkg/integration/vectorvue/rabbitmq_bridge.py`).
- Added live queue-drain CLI (`src/pkg/integration/vectorvue/sync_from_rabbitmq.py`).
- Migrated host integration VectorVue check to broker-backed forwarding path.
- Added unit tests for bridge success/failure handling.

## Explicit Gaps Against Whitepaper Target State

- End-to-end mandatory JWS verification gate before every broker-dispatched command is not universal across all paths.
- Merkle tree ledger and cryptographic inclusion proofs are not implemented (planned in Phase 7).
- SPIFFE/SPIRE and hourly SVID identity rotation are not implemented.
- Firecracker isolation boundary is not implemented (planned in Phase 9).
- C2 gateway adapters (Sliver/Mythic) are roadmap-future.
