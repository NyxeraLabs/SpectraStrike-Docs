# Armory + Universal Runner Execution Fabric
![SpectraStrike Logo](../../ui/web/assets/images/SprectraStrike_Logo.png)

## Scope
This document captures Armory registry controls and standardized edge-runner execution behavior.

## Armory Workflow
1. Ingest BYOT artifact (`tool_name`, `image_ref`, binary payload).
2. Compute immutable digest (`sha256`).
3. Generate SBOM metadata.
4. Run vulnerability summary pipeline.
5. Generate signing metadata.
6. Require explicit approval before digest becomes execution-authorized.

## Standard Runner Workflow
Primary edge runner reference implementation:
- `src/runner-go`

Standard controls:
1. Verify compact JWS on edge side using Ed25519 (`alg=EdDSA`).
2. Resolve authorized tool digest from Armory.
3. Enforce exact digest match against manifest.
4. Execute via firecracker microVM contract (simulation in dev/CI, native in hardened runtime).
5. Map output to CloudEvents (`stdout`, `stderr`, `exit_code`, `manifest_jws`).

## QA Controls
- Forged Ed25519 JWS signatures must fail.
- Tampered tool digests must fail.
- Execution output must map to standardized CloudEvents payload.

## Current Standardization Status
- Go runner verification path is Ed25519-first.
- Firecracker microVM path is the standard runner backend.
- Wrapper SDK contract remains aligned to telemetry/fingerprint/attestation/signature requirements.
