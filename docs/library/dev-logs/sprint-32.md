# Sprint 32 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 9
- Sprint: Sprint 32
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Reporting / Compliance

## Architectural Intent

Implement framework-mapped compliance artifacts aligned to current architecture and telemetry contracts.

## Implementation Detail

Implemented deliverables:
- SOC 2 mapping matrix (`docs/compliance/SOC2_CONTROL_MAPPING.md`)
- ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A mapping matrix (`docs/compliance/ISO27001_ANNEXA_MAPPING.md`)
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 mapping matrix (`docs/compliance/NIST_800_53_MAPPING.md`)
- MITRE ATT&CK telemetry mapping (`docs/compliance/MITRE_ATTACK_TELEMETRY_MAPPING.md`)
- Secure SDLC documentation package (`docs/compliance/SECURE_SDLC_PACKAGE.md`)
- Compliance package index (`docs/compliance/INDEX.md`)
- Manuals index update for compliance package discoverability (`docs/manuals/INDEX.md`)
- Roadmap completion marks for Sprint 32 (`docs/ROADMAP.md`)

## Security and Control Posture

- Maintained Phase 4+ policy-driven architecture posture and OPA delegation model.
- Preserved unified execution fingerprint binding and append-only Merkle ledger references for non-repudiation controls.
- Preserved federation trust model references for mTLS, signature, replay resistance, and tenant boundary enforcement.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Validation evidence:
- Added Sprint 32 QA assertions for roadmap state and compliance package completeness (`tests/qa/test_sprint32_compliance_mapping_qa.py`).
- Ran docs QA and Sprint 32 QA checks for release gating.

## Risk Register

Primary risk remains documentation drift from implementation.
Mitigation:
- dedicated Sprint 32 QA assertions
- mandatory docs QA gate in runbook
- explicit source-code reference columns in mapping artifacts

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 33 focuses on specification publication with backward compatibility guarantees and SDK validation tooling.
