# Sprint 35 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 10
- Sprint: Sprint 35
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Runner identity, attestation, key lifecycle

## Architectural Intent

Extend hardware-assisted isolation with TPM-backed identity contracts, per-execution ephemeral key derivation, and runner-control-plane mutual attestation.

## Implementation Detail

Implemented scope:
- Added Sprint 35 attestation contracts (`src/pkg/runner/attestation.py`)
- Added TPM identity evidence provider (simulation-safe contract)
- Added per-execution ephemeral key derivation using execution context binding
- Added mutual attestation service for runner-control-plane session binding
- Added multi-tenant isolation stress validator for binding-collision checks
- Integrated mutual attestation + ephemeral key metadata into firecracker execution telemetry (`src/pkg/runner/universal.py`)
- Added unit tests and QA checks for Sprint 35 artifacts

## Security and Control Posture

- Zero-trust delegation and execution fingerprint architecture remain intact.
- Firecracker execution path now includes additional identity and session-binding metadata.
- Mutual attestation failures fail closed at execution boundary.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Validation evidence:
- `pytest tests/unit/test_runner_attestation.py`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_universal_edge_runner.py`
- `pytest tests/qa/test_sprint35_mutual_attestation_qa.py`

## Risk Register

Primary risk is simulation/native attestation parity gap for on-prem TPM environments.
Mitigation:
- deterministic contracts in simulation mode
- strict fail-closed mutual attestation checks
- explicit future extension path for real TPM quote verification providers

## Forward Linkage

Phase 10 closure continues with operational hardening and native host deployment runbooks.
