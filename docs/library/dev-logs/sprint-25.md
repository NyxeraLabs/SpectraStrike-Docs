# Sprint 25 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 6
- Sprint: Sprint 25
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Audit & State Plane, Cryptographic Integrity

## Architectural Intent

Define the formal Merkle ledger model contracts required for append-only non-repudiation authority.

## Implementation Detail

Implemented model definitions for:

- Merkle leaf schema bound to unified execution fingerprint and write-ahead intent lineage.
- Strict append-only insertion order with contiguous index enforcement.
- Deterministic tree growth rules (left-right pairing, SHA-256, duplicate-last strategy).
- Root generation cadence based on fixed leaf intervals.
- Root signing procedure contract using control-plane signing authority and canonical JWS payload.
- Inclusion proof structure with typed audit path nodes and signature metadata.

## Security and Control Posture

- Ledger model definitions enforce deterministic hashing and immutable ordering constraints.
- Root signing payload contract is canonicalized to prevent signature ambiguity.
- Inclusion proof schema fixes verifier-facing structure before implementation in Sprint 27.

## QA and Validation Evidence

- Added unit tests covering deterministic leaf hashing, append-order enforcement, cadence behavior, signing payload validation, and inclusion proof constraints.
- Added Sprint 25 QA assertions ensuring roadmap checklist and required model contracts are present.

## Risk Register

- Risk: model parameters may diverge from upcoming runtime implementation.
- Mitigation: Sprint 26 must implement against these exact contracts and retain deterministic tests.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 26 implements append-only Merkle tree runtime and immutable persistence using this model baseline.
