# Sprint 10 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 4
- Sprint: Sprint 10
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Control Plane (Orchestrator Crypto Engine), Execution Contract Layer

## Architectural Intent

Implement the Cryptographic Payload Engine baseline for the Universal Execution Fabric:
- Vault/HSM-backed signing key integration in the control plane
- Compact JWS payload generation for signed execution messages
- Execution Manifest schema formalization for BYOT-safe task dispatch
- Anti-replay controls (nonce + timestamp) to prevent broker/network replay abuse

## Implementation Detail

### Whitepaper-Aligned High-Level Architecture
Sprint 10 implemented the control-plane cryptographic endorsement path described in `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`:
1. Orchestrator constructs canonical execution payloads.
2. Payloads are signed via Vault Transit (HSM-equivalent key custody boundary).
3. Signatures are emitted as compact JWS artifacts for downstream verification.
4. Manifest nonce/timestamp replay guards enforce short-lived, single-use dispatch semantics.

### Logical Architecture and Data Flow
1. Task context + execution parameters are normalized into `ExecutionManifest`.
2. Manifest payload is canonicalized (`sort_keys=True`) for deterministic signing input.
3. `VaultTransitSigner` requests JWS-compatible signature material from Vault Transit.
4. `CompactJWSGenerator` assembles `base64url(header).base64url(payload).base64url(signature)`.
5. `AntiReplayGuard` validates freshness window and tenant-scoped nonce uniqueness before dispatch.

### Detailed Engineering Work by Sprint 10 Tasks
1. **Vault integration for signing keys**
- Added `VaultTransitConfig` + `VaultTransitSigner` for key create/read/sign operations.
- Enforced HTTPS-by-default, runtime config validation, and Vault error hardening.

2. **JWS payload generation in Orchestrator**
- Added compact JWS builder (`CompactJWSGenerator`) with deterministic header/payload encoding.
- Normalized Vault signature formats to compact JWS signature segment output.

3. **Execution Manifest schema design**
- Added `ExecutionTaskContext` and `ExecutionManifest` typed contracts.
- Enforced strict validation for `target_urn`, `tool_sha256`, task context integrity, and manifest versioning.

4. **Anti-Replay mechanisms**
- Added manifest `nonce` field and timestamp usage contract.
- Added `AntiReplayConfig` + `AntiReplayGuard` with max-age, future-skew, and nonce-retention policies.
- Implemented tenant-scoped nonce keying (`tenant_id + nonce`) to preserve isolation semantics.

## Security and Control Posture

- Cryptographic key custody remains externalized to Vault/HSM boundary; private keys never enter app code.
- Signed payload format is deterministic and tamper-evident at transport boundary.
- Replay suppression blocks duplicated nonce use and stale/future timestamp abuse.
- Manifest schema enforces strict target/tool/task context before signing and dispatch.

## QA and Validation Evidence

- Unit suites for Vault signer, JWS generation, manifest schema, and anti-replay completed.
- Focused regression command:
  - `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/unit/test_orchestrator_anti_replay.py tests/unit/test_orchestrator_manifest.py tests/unit/test_orchestrator_jws.py tests/unit/test_orchestrator_signing.py`
- Result: passing in local dev workflow during sprint closeout.

## Risk Register

- Remaining risk: anti-replay store is in-memory only; production durability/distributed replay cache is deferred to later execution-plane work.
- Remaining risk: OPA policy pre-sign authorization hooks are scheduled for Phase 5 and not yet enforced in this sprint.
- Remaining risk: edge-side JWS verification enforcement is scheduled in Sprint 12 runner implementation.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 11 proceeds with Armory implementation (immutable tool registry, ingestion pipeline, and tool-signing supply-chain controls).
