# Sprint 6 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 3
- Sprint: Sprint 6
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Detection Engine, Telemetry Ingestion

## Architectural Intent

Implement Nmap wrapper orchestration with structured result parsing and orchestrator telemetry handoff.

## Implementation Detail

Wrapper command-building logic, scan mode support, XML parsing, normalization, and telemetry emission integration were implemented, including logging instrumentation.

## Security and Control Posture

- AAA scope and authorization boundaries are enforced according to current orchestrator policy.
- Telemetry and audit events are expected to remain structured, attributable, and export-ready.
- Integration interfaces are maintained as loosely coupled contracts to preserve VectorVue interoperability.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Unit coverage validated command construction, parsing semantics, error handling, and ingestion pipeline compatibility.

## Risk Register

Primary risk was runtime privilege mismatch for scan modes; mitigated later with unprivileged fallback enhancements.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 7 targeted QA validation of scan behavior and AAA boundaries.
