# Sprint 19 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 5.5
- Sprint: Sprint 19
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Control Plane, Policy Plane, Key and Secret Plane

## Architectural Intent

Harden control-plane integrity gates so startup and cryptographic trust anchors are verifiable and tamper-evident.

## Implementation Detail

Completed Sprint 19 controls:
- Added JWS-based signed startup configuration enforcement (`pkg.orchestrator.control_plane_integrity`).
- Enforced startup rejection for unsigned/invalid signatures.
- Added OPA policy hash pinning and explicit mismatch denial handling.
- Added runtime binary SHA-256 baseline validation against signed envelope.
- Added append-only immutable configuration version history with hash chaining.
- Added dedicated tamper-evident integrity audit channel (`spectrastrike.audit.integrity`).
- Added automated Vault transit signing-key rotation workflow.
- Added hardened Vault unseal share validation policy (threshold, uniqueness, share quality).
- Added unit and QA coverage for all above controls.

## Security and Control Posture

- Startup trust now requires signed config + pinned policy + binary baseline checks before success path.
- Integrity-critical events are separately hash chained for tamper-evident auditability.
- Vault lifecycle controls (rotation/unseal) are now codified as explicit workflows.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Commands:
- `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_control_plane_integrity.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_vault_hardening.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_orchestrator_signing.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_logging_framework.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/qa/test_sprint19_control_integrity_qa.py`

## Risk Register

Residual risk:
- Runtime baseline currently verifies local binary hash and depends on secured deployment pipeline for golden hash provenance.
- Vault unseal workflow validates policy constraints but does not perform live Vault unseal operations in unit scope.

## Forward Linkage

Sprint 20 advances high-assurance AAA controls (hardware-backed MFA, dual-control approvals, and break-glass hardening).
