# Sprint 3 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 2
- Sprint: Sprint 3
- Status: Completed
- Primary Architecture Layers: Orchestration Pipeline, Reporting / Compliance

## Architectural Intent

Validate orchestrator functional behavior, AAA enforcement, and telemetry output shape under repeatable QA controls.

## Implementation Detail

QA scenarios exercised task execution paths, authorization constraints, and telemetry emission semantics to ensure deterministic control-plane behavior.

## Security and Control Posture

- AAA scope and authorization boundaries are enforced according to current orchestrator policy.
- Telemetry and audit events are expected to remain structured, attributable, and export-ready.
- Integration interfaces are maintained as loosely coupled contracts to preserve VectorVue interoperability.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Functional tests, telemetry validation checks, and access-control QA were completed to harden engine readiness.

## Risk Register

Primary risk was silent policy bypass during task submission; mitigated through explicit authorization tests and audit validation.

## Forward Linkage

Phase 3 shifted focus to external integration and API transport security.
