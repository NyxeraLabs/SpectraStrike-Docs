# Sprint 9.8 Engineering Log

## Program Context

- Phase: Phase 3
- Sprint: Sprint 9.8
- Status: Completed (with explicit web UI dependency blocker)
- Primary Architecture Layers: Reporting / Compliance, Orchestration Pipeline, Telemetry Ingestion

## Architectural Intent

Consolidate QA evidence for messaging, UI/TUI, hardening, and documentation into a release-governance sprint before Phase 4.

## Implementation Detail

Cross-suite pytest execution validated messaging, remote endpoint integration, admin TUI workflows, AAA/audit controls, and docs schema/link integrity. Roadmap and kanban were updated with exact blocker outputs for npm registry DNS failures and missing web UI toolchain binaries.

## Security and Control Posture

- AAA scope and authorization boundaries are enforced according to current orchestrator policy.
- Telemetry and audit events are expected to remain structured, attributable, and export-ready.
- Integration interfaces are maintained as loosely coupled contracts to preserve VectorVue interoperability.

## QA and Validation Evidence

Consolidated suite passed (`39 passed`), compose policy checks passed, and docs QA automation was added in `tests/qa/test_docs_qa.py`. Web UI dependency bootstrap remains environment-blocked where DNS to the npm registry is unavailable.

## Risk Register

Primary risk is incomplete UI regression in isolated networks. Mitigation is an internal dependency mirror strategy or a controlled connected CI lane for `vitest` and `playwright`.


## Forward Linkage

Sprint 10 begins Phase 4 Cobalt Strike integration implementation.

## Addendum: Governance and Legal Enforcement

Post-sprint governance hardening introduced a unified legal enforcement subsystem across web auth middleware and CLI startup paths. The implementation is environment-aware (`self-hosted`, `enterprise`, `saas`), version-driven, and includes local self-hosted acceptance storage under `.spectrastrike/legal/acceptance.json`.

Governance add-ons delivered:
- central legal version configuration (`EULA`, `AUP`, `PRIVACY`)
- re-acceptance invalidation flow when versions change
- legal gate before token issuance and protected API authorization checks
- CLI legal gate at admin-shell initialization
- SQL schema drafts for enterprise installation-level and future SaaS user-level legal acceptance
